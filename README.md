<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project is a visual YouTube app clone made in Flutter for learning purposes. The main goal was to build an app that emulates the core features of the YouTube app. All the data displayed in the app is mocked with fake data and no real data is fetched.

As my first project in Flutter, I created this app to learn and practice the basics of building a mobile application with Flutter. The project gave me the opportunity to gain hands-on experience with Flutter widgets, navigation, HTTP requests, and more.

Although the app is not intended for production use, it serves as a valuable learning resource for those who are new to Flutter or mobile app development in general.
